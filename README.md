# Hacker News Website
A website that show the latest hacker news with an option to show comments that was done in August, 2019.
This is a project that was done to practice my skills in Javascript and the skills actually working with an API.


The api is obtained from: https://github.com/HackerNews/API

### Places to improve
1. As it is just a project focusing on javascript, calling the api and rendering the results, not much efforts were put in designing the interace.
2. Should just render few comments at a time instead of rendering all at one time.
