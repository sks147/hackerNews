# Hacker News Website
A website that show the latest hacker news with comments that was done in August, 2019.
This is a project that was done to practice my skills in Javascript and the skills actually working with an API.


The api is obtained from: https://github.com/HackerNews/API

### Places to improve
1. As mainly it is just a project focusing on calling the api and rendering the results, not much efforts were put in designing the interace.
2. More time should be put in tidying up the code.
